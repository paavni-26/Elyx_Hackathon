# Elyx Health Journey Tracker  

## Overview  
Elyx is building the future of healthcare where AI collaborates with specialists to maximize healthy years in a person’s life.  
This project was built during a **3-day hackathon** to demonstrate how Elyx can provide **personalized healthcare journeys**, combining medical data, wearable data, and behavioral insights into a single web-based experience.  

We designed a system for:  
- Tracking a member’s health progress over time  
- Generating **WhatsApp-style communication messages** between Elyx team and members  
- Providing **personalized recommendations** (exercise, nutrition, mental health)  
- Visualizing progress through **dashboards and trackers**

## Features  
- **Member Onboarding** – basic profile, health history, and goals input  
- **Health Data Uploads** – test results (e.g., glucose, HbA1c, iron, Vitamin D, heart rate)  
- **WhatsApp-style Chat System** – AI-generated conversations between member & Elyx team  
- **Dynamic Reports** – diagnostic test outcomes every 3 months, lifestyle plan updates every 2 weeks  
- **Dashboards** – interactive visualizations (e.g., resilience tracker, consultation time analysis, nutrient cycle & sugar level tracker)  
- **Member Journey Tracking** – see current status and trace decisions back to rationale
